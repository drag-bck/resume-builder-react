                    &nbsp;from January, 2018 to March, 2018<br/>Software Testing on the project - System Based Technical Feasibility- HVDS cases.Liquid Propellant Storage and Service Facilities carries out the activities relating to storage and transfer of Earth storable propellants and servicing the liquid and cryo stages of the rockets during the countdown for the launch. Our project is to design a screen through which various parameters like Temperature, Pressure, etc. could be monitored and controlled.

                    <b>Air Quality Monitoring System</b>
                    <br/>Air Quality Monitoring System is designed to check the quality of air in the surrounding using MQ-7 and MQ-135 gas sensors. MQ-7 gives the value for CO and MQ-135 for CO2. Bluetooth module connected to arduino board transfers the serial data to android app which shows the real-time data values with the changing graph after every 10 secs. The values are being stored in the database with the respective location..

                    <b>Student Monitoring System</b>
                    <br/>I worked as Front-end developer and Team Leader. This project is very useful to students to see their academic performance from anywhere at any time. I provided new features for this system that are, effective and easy user interface for students, parents and staff. It also provides a chat interface through which students can clarify their doubts personally. And parents can also view their childrens up-to-date academic performance at any time, duration, cost and their arrival and departure dates.
